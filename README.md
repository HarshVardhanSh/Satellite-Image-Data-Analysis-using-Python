# Satellite-Image-Data-Analysis-using-Python
Data Source: Satellite Image from WIFIRE Project  WIFIRE is an integrated system for wildfire analysis, with specific regard to changing urban dynamics and climate. The system integrates networked observations such as heterogeneous satellite data and real-time remote sensor data, with computational techniques in signal processing, visualization, modeling, and data assimilation to provide a scalable method to monitor such phenomena as weather patterns that can help predict a wildfire's rate of spread. You can read more about WIFIRE at: https://wifire.ucsd.edu/  In this example, we will analyze a sample satellite image dataset from WIFIRE using the numpy Library.
